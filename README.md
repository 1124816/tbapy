# tbapy

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tbapy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tbapy)

Unofficial Python library to get data from The Blue Alliance.

This library returns JSON-parsed data fetched from The Blue Alliance's API.

Compatible with Python 2 and 3.

## Setup
First, install the module:

    pip install tbapy

Then, to use these functions, you must import the `tbapy` module:

```py
import tbapy
```

Before using the library, you must instantiate its class, providing your application's ID in the format `author:application:version`, for example:

```py
tba = tbapy.TBA('frc254:cheesy_arena:v2.2')
```

or

```py
tba = tbapy.TBA('woodie_flowers:scouting-system:5')
```

The Blue Alliance's API requires that all applications identify themselves when retrieving data.
